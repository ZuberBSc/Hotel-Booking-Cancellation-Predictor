# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation-Predictor
This project focuses on predicting hotel booking cancellations using a comprehensive dataset of reservations. The analysis includes a full data science workflow — from data cleaning and feature engineering to model training and evaluation — with the goal of identifying factors that influence cancellations and building a predictive model for them.
